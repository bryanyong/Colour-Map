# Colour-Map

This work was  in order to produce a colour map for a prototype colorimeter our team designed as consultants for Open Diagnostics, a non-profit research team in Cambridge in order to provide a cheap and effective method to diagnose colour changes in synthetic-engineering strips (Using genetic information in flash-frozen bacteria that change colour when exposed to a particular virus or chemical, ie. the strip turns red when exposed to Malaria in water). 

The code provided in this repository is written by me. The first, is the code needed to operate the arduino and pull sensor readings from the LEDs and LDRs in our prototype. The data is then processed and exported into Matlab for pliotting and analysis.
